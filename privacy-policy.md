Privacy Policy
==============

crunchy-skip is a browser extension that runs entirely on your device. This document describes what data the extension handles and how it is used.

Information We Collect
----------------------
- The extension does **not** collect, transmit, or sell any personal information.
- No browsing history, account data, or video metadata ever leaves your browser.

Local Storage
-------------
- The extension uses Chrome's `storage.sync` (or `storage.local`) API to save the preferences you configure in the options page (e.g., whether to skip intros or credits, click delay, and debug logging).
- These settings are the only data stored, and they remain within Chrome's managed storage. If you sign in to Chrome and enable sync, Google may copy these settings between your own devices; we never see them.

Network Requests
----------------
- The extension does not perform any network requests beyond the normal Crunchyroll traffic generated by your browser. No external servers are contacted by the extension code.

Third Parties
-------------
- The extension ships with all of its code bundled locally. It does not load remote scripts or include analytics/advertising libraries.

Data Retention and Control
--------------------------
- You can remove the stored settings at any time by uninstalling the extension or clicking "Reset to defaults" in the options page.
- Because all data is local, deleting the extension immediately removes all stored information.

Contact
-------
If you have questions about this policy or the extension, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
